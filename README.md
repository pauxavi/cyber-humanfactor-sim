With the rapid development of CPS technology, it has been increasingly integrated into people's daily life - people have become an integral part of the whole system. Especially for the large and intelligent CPS, the decision-maker team plays an important role in the operation of the system.

Physical domain, information domain and social domain cover devices, information and people respectively. The integration and blending of these three domains is a major problem in CPSS analysis -- not only the interaction and dependence within the domain, but also the cross domain interaction and dependence. This relationship can be positive, reverse, two-way, or one-to-one, one to many, many to one.

We intend to explore the cascading failure relationship between component failure and malware propagation from the coupling of physical domain and information domain.

The 4 .nlogo files here are the experimental files used in our research.

The subsequent plan considers the coupling of physical domain and social domain (at the bottom of the system, people often directly face physical devices, and the interaction between people and physical devices should be taken into consideration), and the coupling of information domain and social domain (at the top of the system, decision makers often face the data integrated and analyzed by information system, and the information carried by software interacts with decision makers / decision teams. At this time, we should consider the interaction between human and software.)
